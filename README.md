# ML-Project with MLflow Integration

This repository demonstrates an end-to-end Machine Learning project lifecycle managed with MLflow. It includes the integration of MLflow for experiment tracking, model management, and deployment.

## Setting Up the Project with MLflow

To set up this project with MLflow, ensure you have MLflow installed. You can install MLflow using pip:

```
pip install mlflow
```

Additionally, ensure all project dependencies are installed by running:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running Experiments and Managing Models with MLflow

To run experiments and manage models with MLflow, execute the `ml_project_lifecycle.py` script:

```
python ml_project_lifecycle.py
```

This script demonstrates the lifecycle of a Machine Learning project, including initializing an MLflow experiment, logging parameters, metrics, and models, and tracking experiments.
